This document describes the JSON manifest format used by Moonshine for Lua solo
modes. It focuses on the rules modders must follow.

## Overview
- The manifest is required and must be valid before a session can start.
- JSON properties are case-insensitive.
- `manifestVersion` and `apiVersion` are integers; only value `1` is supported.
  Missing values default to `1`.
- Identifiers (`id`) must be unique within their collection and must not
  collide across badges, variations, leaderboards, and menu entries.
- Milestones define the progression tree and back the access/visibility rules
  of other blocks.

## Required metadata
- `author` (string, required): informational display.
- `manifestVersion` (int, required): only value `1` is supported.
- `apiVersion` (int, required): only value `1` is supported.
- `name` (string, required): mode name.
- `scriptVersion` (string, required): free-form.
- `entryPoint` (string, required): relative path to the main Lua script.
  - Must live under the manifest folder and under `GAME_ROOT/Lua`.
  - Used to derive the module name (`path/to/file.lua` becomes `path.to.file`).
- `description` (string, optional).
- `modeType` (string, optional): present but not consumed yet.

## Progression and milestones
- `milestones` (string array, required but may be empty).
- Moonshine can also read `milestones.txt` next to the `entryPoint` to know which
  milestones are unlocked for the player. It is separate from `SaveState.txt`.
  - One milestone id per line; only the first token before whitespace is used.
  - Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments.
- Any `AccessControlledElement` (badges, variations, menu entries/options,
  leaderboards) may define:
  - `requiredMilestone`: milestone that unlocks access.
  - `visibleFromMilestone`: milestone that makes the element visible before
    unlock.
- References to unknown milestones are invalid.

## Badges
- Optional `badges` array.
- Fields:
  - `id` (string, required, <= 32 chars).
  - `label` (string, required, <= 32).
  - `description` / `earnedDescription` (optional).
  - `iconRect` (required): `width` and `height` must be > 0.
  - `overrideBadge` (optional): badge being replaced.
  - `requiredMilestone` / `visibleFromMilestone` (optional) must target known
    milestones.
- `id` values must be unique and must not collide with variation, leaderboard,
  or menu ids.

## Variations and menus
- `variations` array is required (at least one variation).
- Variation:
  - `id` (required, <= 32).
  - `label` (required, <= 32).
  - `description` / `earnedDescription` (optional).
  - `refreshRate` (optional): when present, must be between `30` and `120`
    (currently validated but not used at runtime).
  - `inputBuffer` (optional): when present, must be between `0` and `5`
    (currently validated but not used at runtime).
  - `requiredMilestone` / `visibleFromMilestone` (optional).
  - `menuInputs` (optional).
- `menuInputs` (top-level or nested in options):
  - `id` (required, <= 32) and `label` (required, <= 32).
  - `type` (optional): currently only `select` is supported. When missing or
    `select` (case-insensitive), `options` is required and must contain at
    least 2 entries.
  - `options` (optional otherwise).
  - `requiredMilestone` / `visibleFromMilestone` (optional).
- `options` (required for `select`):
  - `label` (required, <= 32): used as the selection value passed to Lua and
    the override file.
  - `description` / `earnedDescription` (optional).
  - `inputs` (optional): allows nesting new `menuInputs`.
  - `requiredMilestone` / `visibleFromMilestone` (optional).
- Uniqueness:
  - Variation ids are unique.
  - `menuInputs` ids must be unique across all variations.
  - Id collisions across `Badge`, `Variation`, `RankingTable`, and `MenuInput`
    are not allowed.

## Leaderboards (rankingTables)
- Optional `rankingTables` array.
- Fields:
  - `id` (required, <= 32, unique).
  - `label` (required, <= 32).
  - `columns` (required, non-empty).
  - `requiredMilestone` / `visibleFromMilestone` (optional, must target known
    milestones).
- Columns:
  - `label` (required, <= 32).
  - `type` (required): `Badge`, `Chrono`, or `Point`.

## Resources (resources.images)
- Optional `resources` block.
- `images`: list of images keyed by `id` (uniqueness enforced).
  - `source`: required relative path to an image under the manifest folder.
  - `sprites` (optional): each sprite has `id` (unique per image), `x`, `y`,
    `width`, `height`.
    - `id` values may repeat across different images but not within the same
      image.

## Package obfuscation
- `obfuscatePackageContent` (bool, default `true`):
  - If `true` (default), manifest, scripts, and images are obfuscated in the
    package to avoid trivial inspection.
  - If `false`, the package stores files in clear text and is expected to be
    read as such.

## Integration reminders for modders
- The manifest must live under `GAME_ROOT/Lua`; absolute paths are forbidden.
- `entryPoint` must be inside the manifest folder; escaping the root is invalid.
- Modder mode requires valid `playerId`/`accessToken` configuration; otherwise
  the session will not start.
- `SaveState.txt` next to the `entryPoint` is loaded automatically if present.
- `milestones.txt` is read separately to drive access control; do not put
  modder state in that file.
